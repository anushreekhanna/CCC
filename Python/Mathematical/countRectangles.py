#This coding problem is from SPOJ
'''
Nestor was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is
tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow.
His mathâ€™s teacher gives him two numbers a and b. The problem consist of
finding the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Nestor
with his problem. You are given two integer numbers:
    the base a (0 <= a <= 20) and the index b (0 <= b <= 2,147,483,000),
    a and b both are not 0. You have to find the last digit of ab.

Input
The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30).
t test cases follow. For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.

Output
For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.

Example
Input:
2
3 10
6 2

Output:
9
6

#Math behind this coding problem
'''
-Greatest length/breadth of rectangle that can be formed is n*1
-so our goal is to find number of unique combinations such that
l*h<=n i.e; 3*2 and 2*3 are same
-So we iterate the breadth from length (j=i)
