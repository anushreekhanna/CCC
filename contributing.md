## Contribution Guidelines 
>### Headers 
  - Now, these must be present above the code your trying to implement, in the form of comments. 
  An example would be: 
    ```
    /*
    * Created Date: Thursday May 30th 2019
    * Author: Gurubalan Harikrishnan
    * Email-ID: gurubalan.work@gmail.com
    * -----
    * Copyright (c) 2019 Gurubalan Harikrishnan
    */
    ```
    This is a header usually, auto-generated by VSCode. For more details click [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=psioniq.psi-header). 
    
    Another example implemented well enough would be [this](/C++/Ad-Hoc/DiscovertheRightNumber.cpp)
    by [@Rajeshwari](https://github.com/Yorunome).

    Now, If you're solving from Hackerrank, CodeChef, Hackerearth and so on, do mention where this is from, and if possible the link to it also. So this would go like : 
    ```
    /* From Hackerrank, Link : https://thelink.com */
    ```
    This will later help in the future to redesign the file structure based on coding sites which has been solved.

>### File Names
  - The go to format followed here is `camelCase`, preferably no spaces in-between file names (Makes it easier for terminal based access) *or* file names can be seperated by a `-` to mention alternative implementations and so on. ( Eg: fibonacci-Recursion.ext )
  - **Important** : Do remember camelCase is followed only for file structures and not code. That is the respective native language syntax.
  
>### Pull Requests 
  - If you have any doubts in your code or want to submit for a review you can do any of these: 
    - Pull up issues and mark the respective label for it, so people can discuss.
    - Fork the repository, create a new branch in the repository and push your changes into that branch.
      - Example : For creating a new branch and switching between them :
      ```
      $ git branch <branch_name>
      $ git checkout <branch_name>
      ```
      You can also do both with a single command :
      ```
      $ git checkout -b <branch_name>
      ```
    - After pushing the changes, make a pull request so that others can review and comment on the respective changes. This will be taken as a merge request as well, and after the code is reviewed, the collaborators/Me can merge the `new branch` with the `master` branch and delete the `new branch` which you created. 
      
      This is a repository-safe method and is the most recommended way to go, if you're not sure or have some doubts in what you're pushing.

      Example : Go to the pull requests tab and click the button '✔ SomeNumber Closed', see the requests made by [@anushreekhanna](https://github.com/anushreekhanna) and [@ganesh-sadanala](https://github.com/ganesh-sadanala) who have done the following. 

>### Competitive coding
  - There is a dedicated folder in each of the language directories, with the headers being explained, the competitive codes can be pushed there and later sorted according to the sources. 

>### Issues
  - Additional labels have been added to the issues tab, if you have an additional topic/label you want to add or actually add/change feautures in this repository, create issues using the label - `Update/Changes/Requests`.
  
  - Doubts can also be raised and hence there can be several threads about it.
