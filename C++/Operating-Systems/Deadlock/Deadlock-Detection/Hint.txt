- Same as deadlock avoidance using banker's algorithm, only difference is, check wheather the finish[] array is actually completely 1,
which signifies all have been finished and all are true (Found value becomes true at the end).
- So instead of checking the bool found value, check the finish[] array values, where all of them should be 1. If any one is 0, then
in a loop, the i'th instance of that array, is actually the process which is in deadlock state.
