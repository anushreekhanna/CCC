Question source: HackerRank
Description: Previously, it was important for every company to have a motto.

Now, it is important for every company to have a banner.

Since companies want to save their resources, they decided to convert their motto into a banner.

How this works is, you create a square matrix of size N x N, and fill in the elements of this
matrix using the motto in row-major order.The remaining spaces in the matrix are called waste
cells and are to be represented as '?'.You have to choose N in such a way that the number of
waste cells is minimized.

Input:
Input consists of one line only, containing the company motto

Output:
Output must consist of the matrix formed from the input string

Notes:
The length of the input string will not exceed 1000
Sample Input 0
nike - just do it!
Sample Output 0
